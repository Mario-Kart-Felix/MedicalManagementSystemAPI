Next Update:

Removing username from the register api call, coz it's not fare to ask a username from user when
the register an account?

The user can recover the username without verifying there account. (If the user accidently enter the
wrong email, so the username of that user will be in used, so they can't use that username, when they
will try to register an account with the valid email).

2) It's not fare to ask too much information from the register page.

3) Create a random username for each user,
	1) Remove the whitespace from there name, and check that the username is availabe or not.
	   If not available attach the some random numbers or random words, and again check it the
	   username is avaialbe or, repeat this process untill we not fetch a non register usename. ok
	2) if the from above process got the username, send it the database with username.
